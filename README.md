# University InternshipHub

Welcome to University InternshipHub, a platform designed to streamline the internship placement process for campus students, companies, and administrators.

## Abstract

The "University InternshipHub" project aims to enhance and simplify the internship placement process for students, companies, and administrators within the university ecosystem. By providing a user-friendly platform powered by the latest technology, the system facilitates seamless communication and interaction among these key stakeholders.

Students can create profiles, specify job preferences, and benefit from automatic job searching functionalities tailored to their preferences. Additionally, quizzes are available to help students enhance their job application skills, with marks reflecting their competencies. Mentor videos covering essential topics such as CV writing and interview preparation further support student development.

Organizations can easily post available internships, manage applications, and maintain profiles from anywhere. Administrators play a crucial role in creating quizzes and mentorship videos, overseeing system maintenance, and managing other administrative tasks.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Utilized for interface programming, React's component-based design and virtual DOM enable swift UI rendering and enhance user interaction.
- **Bootstrap CSS Library**: Provides pre-defined elements and reactive grid systems for frontend styling and layout design, ensuring responsiveness across various platforms and screen sizes.

### Backend
- **Spring Boot**: Serves as the core web application framework for building RESTful APIs and managing business data. Its convention-over-configuration approach simplifies backend development and deployment.
- **MongoDB**: Acts as the NoSQL database for storing and organizing user data, internship information, applications, and educational resources. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it ideal for managing diverse data types and sizes.

### Version Control
- **GitHub**: Used for collaborative development and code management, GitHub facilitates group work, tracks project changes, and manages code repositories efficiently. Features like issue tracking and pull requests streamline collaboration and code review processes.
